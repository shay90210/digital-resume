                        <p>
                            I am a dedicated, solutions-driven professional with
                            a unique blend of experience across education, neuro
                            rehabilitation, and emerging technology. With a
                            Bachelor of Science in Education and English, I've
                            built a strong foundation in communciation,
                            instructional design, and learner centered problem
                            solving. My work in neuro rehab strengethened my
                            ability to assess needs, support individuals through
                            complex challenges, and collaborate across
                            multidisciplinary teams - all skills that translate
                            seamlessly into both health consulting and technical
                            environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently expanding my expertise into
                            technology and cybersecurity, pairing my background
                            in systems thinking, data-driven decision making,
                            and program coordination with new technical
                            competencies. Whether I'm optimizing processes,
                            delivering client-centered support, or breaking down
                            complex information for diverse audiences, I bring
                            adaptibility, clarity, and a commitment to
                            meaningful impact. I'm passionate about bridging
                            human-centered care with modern technology to create
                            solutions that are accessible, efficient, and
                            transformative.
